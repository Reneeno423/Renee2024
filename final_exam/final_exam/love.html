            <hr>
            <p>Despite having existed for 45 years, Snowshoes are rare due to the difficulty of reproducing the correct coat markings.</p>

            However your snowshoe's personality shapes up, they are all deeply social cats, interacting well with children, other cats, and cat-friendly dogs. Conversely, they do not tend to do well on their own, so single-pet snowshoes may develop separation anxiety if they are left home alone for extended periods of time</p>

        <p>Some secure outdoor space, either in the form of a fully secured garden or a purpose-built cat run will be beneficial to their physical and mental health. Fresh air and sunshine are good for all cats and the Snowshoe is no exception.</p>
