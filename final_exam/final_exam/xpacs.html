            <p>Snowshoe cats are known to get along well with children and other pets. The breed is usually mellow and sweet natured with a sociable personality. These cats thrive under the care of their owners, so they don't fare well if left alone for long durations.</p>

        <p> Originally called “Silver Laces,” the snowshoe cat breed originated in Philadelphia, Penn., 45 years ago but to this day remains one of the rarest breeds in the United States.</p>
