      <p>Welcome to a safe place. I'm here to help everyone see it's ALL ABOUT LOVE and not hate. Hate spreads like wildfire through our nation right now. I'm here to SCREAM stop the hate. We are all humans and WE all need love. Don't feed into the darkness of hate because LOVE is what brings light into us.</p>
