            <hr>
            <p>Eastern legends, such as those of China and Japan, dragons are good creatures. They lack wings but can fly, and they live in water. They are thought to control rivers and the rain and wind. In Chinese culture, dragons are symbols of power and luck. 
                dragon, in the mythologies, legends, and folktales of various cultures, a large lizard- or serpent-like creature, conceived in some traditions as evil and in others as beneficent. In medieval Europe, dragons were usually depicted with wings and a barbed tail and as breathing fire. 
                The dragon is a symbol of evil, in both the chivalric and Christian traditions. In the Orient, it symbolizes supernatural power, wisdom, strength, and hidden knowledge. In most traditions, it is the embodiment of chaos and untamed nature.</p>
